- **Show Appointments**: View all scheduled appointments for a specific client, where you can easily edit or delete appointments as needed.

- **Add Appointment**: Schedule a new appointment for the selected client.

## Confirmation Popups

To ensure smooth confirmation and prevent accidental actions, the dashboard features popup notifications at the top. These notifications will confirm the successful addition, update, or deletion of appointments. Additionally, for critical actions like deletion, a confirmation prompt will ensure your intentions are clear.

## Trainer's Calendar

To access your comprehensive calendar and view all scheduled appointments across clients, simply click the "Your Calendar" button in the Navbar. This will redirect you to [localhost:3000/Calendar](http://localhost:3000/Calendar), where you can see your overall schedule efficiently.

Feel free to explore the intuitive interface and make the most out of the FitTrac for seamless appointment management! üìÖüí™
